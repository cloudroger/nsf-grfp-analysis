# NSF GRFP Award Data Analysis

Repository contains text data of previous awardee names, ugrad/grad institution, field of study, and year awarded.

Additionally, the scrape script for either HM or Awardees and a python notebook demonstrating how to load/manipulate the data are provided. 



## Note

- No additional processing has been performed on the data
- Universities are named inconsistently, thus there are duplicate entries for schools. Example: University of Texas-Austin and University of Texas Austin.
- Some duplicate awardees are present
- Recipients can elect to not have their information posted to fastlane, so there may be missing entries
